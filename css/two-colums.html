  <p>Windows users:</p>

  <p>A KNOWN BUG IN THE RELEASE is that NUMLOCK must be turned off in order
    to fire the bow with the
    numeric keypad. If you can't fire, try turning off NUMLOCK on your keyboard.</p>

  <p>Right now there is no fancy installer, but you can still download and
  run the game with a few
    clicks.</p>

  <p>First, your browser will probably ask you whether to Open the download,
    or Save it to disk. CHOOSE SAVE TO DISK and put it wherever you want. If
    you are just trying out the game, you can put it on
    your Windows desktop.</p>

  <p>Second, RIGHT-CLICK the sanctuary-beta.zip file and choose EXTRACT or
    EXPAND or UNZIP (this may vary depending on your version of Windows.) If it
    asks for a destination folder, choose the Desktop.</p>

  <p>Third and finally, DOUBLE-CLICK the sanctuary-beta folder that should now
    be on the Desktop. The folder should open into an Explorer window. Scroll
    down to SANCTUARY.EXE and double-click it. That's it! Sorry, we are working
    on improving the installer.</p>
